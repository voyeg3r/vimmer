# Intro

Vim is a modal editor, this means that typing `0` in normal mode will not
insert zero, instead it takes the cursor to the beginning of the line. This at
the beginning can make things difficult but at long run will make you much more
productive.

The first advice is to find a good Cheat Sheet (good visual reference card)
to help you to master the basic of each mode.
